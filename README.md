## Why CodeType?

CodeType turns real code into a fast, playful game inside VS Code. It opens as a normal-looking file tab (like `solo.ts` or `team.ts`) so you can squeeze in a round during vibe coding sessions without leaving your editor.

## Features

- Stealth tab names and editor-like UI
- Real code snippets from your workspace or curated samples
- Solo and Team rooms with invite codes
- Local stats, streaks, and best WPM; sign in to sync and rank globally
- Themes and optional typing sounds
- Quick launch with `Cmd+Shift+T` / `Ctrl+Shift+T`

## Install

- VS Code Marketplace: search for "CodeType" and install
- Command line:

```bash
code --install-extension codetype.codetype
```

## Play

1. Open the Command Palette and run `CodeType: Play Game`.
2. Choose Solo or Team.
3. Type the snippet and chase higher WPM and accuracy.

## Scoring

- WPM: characters typed / 5 / minutes elapsed
- Accuracy: correct keystrokes / total keystrokes
