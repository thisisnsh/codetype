    <p>At CodeType, we believe in transparency and respect for your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we
      collect, use, and protect your information when you use our application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect minimal information necessary to provide our service:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Name and Email Address:</strong> When you sign in with Google, we collect your name and email
        address to identify you as a user. This helps us provide support when needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data. This includes:
        <ul>
          <li>App opens and session duration</li>
          <li>Feature usage (e.g., game modes, settings changes)</li>
          <li>Navigation patterns within the app</li>
          <li>Platform information (Windows/macOS/Linux)</li>
        </ul>
        This data helps us understand how CodeType is used and prioritize improvements. Your email is hashed before
        being used as an identifier, ensuring your identity remains protected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's it. We don't collect anything else.</p>

    <h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>
    <p>We want to be crystal clear about what stays on your device:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Your Code and Snippets:</strong> Code you type or load remains local to your machine and never
        leaves your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication Tokens:</strong> Your Google authentication tokens are stored locally on your
        device. We don't have access to them.</li>
      <li><strong>Workspace Content:</strong> We never read or transmit your project files or workspace data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Store Your Information</h2>
    <p>The limited information we collect (name and email) is stored securely using Google Cloud infrastructure.
      We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your name and email solely to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify you as a CodeType user</li>
      <li>Provide customer support when you contact us</li>
      <li>Send important updates about the service (very rarely)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will never sell your information to third parties or use it for advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>CodeType integrates with the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Authentication:</strong> We use Google services for authentication. When you use this
        feature, you're also subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
        We only request the minimum permissions necessary to sign you in.</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics (a Google service) to collect anonymous
        usage statistics. This service helps us understand app usage patterns and improve CodeType. Firebase
        Analytics data is processed according to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase's
        Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Google User Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Sharing or Transfer:</strong> We do not share, transfer, or disclose your Google user data with
        anyone.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited Scope Access:</strong> We only request basic profile and email scopes required for sign-in.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Local Token Storage:</strong> Your Google authentication token is never persisted or transferred to
        any server. It remains stored locally on your system and never leaves your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> We only store your email address and name as part of the
        authentication process. If you wish to have this information removed, please email us at
        <a href="mailto:support@codetype.ai">support@codetype.ai</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your basic account information (name and email) for as long as you use CodeType. Analytics data
      is retained according to Firebase Analytics' default retention period. If you wish to have your
      information deleted, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@codetype.ai">support@codetype.ai</a>.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access the personal information we hold about you</li>
      <li>Request correction of any inaccurate information</li>
      <li>Request deletion of your information</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent at any time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take security seriously. Your local data is protected by your operating system's security features.
      The information stored in our cloud infrastructure is protected using industry-standard encryption and
      security measures.</p>
