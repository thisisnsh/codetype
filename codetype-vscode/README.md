# CodeType

**Type code for fun while vibe coding.**

A typing game that lives inside VS Code. It opens as a normal-looking file tab so you can squeeze in a quick round between builds without leaving your editor.

## Features

**Stealth Mode** — The game disguises itself as a regular code file (`solo.ts`, `team.ts`) so it blends right into your workspace.

**Real Code Snippets** — Practice typing actual code from your own workspace or choose from curated samples across multiple languages.

**Solo & Team Play** — Play alone to beat your personal best, or create a room and invite teammates with a share code for live multiplayer races.

**Stats & Streaks** — Track your WPM, accuracy, and daily streaks locally. Sign in to sync your progress and compete on global leaderboards.

**Themes** — Choose from three themes: Stealth, Minimal, or Hacker.

**Typing Sounds** — Optional keyboard sounds for extra immersion.

## Quick Start

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+T` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+T` (Windows/Linux)
2. Choose Solo or Team
3. Start typing and chase a higher WPM

Or open the Command Palette and run `CodeType: Play Game`.
